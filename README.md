# CS5721-Pharm-E-Cart
The rapid digitalization of healthcare and pharmaceutical industries has created a need for secure and user-friendly software solutions that enable efficient and safe medicine ordering which we aim to provide through our software which we’ve named as “Pharm-e-cart”. The main stakeholders involved in this portal include the Customers who are the end-users, the Pharmaceutical companies who are responsible for manufacturing the medicines, and the Pharmacy owners who supply the products to the customers.
To ensure a seamless experience for customers interested in utilizing the platform, we have implemented a user registration system. This registration process allows users to create their credentials by providing some basic personal details like Name and Date of Birth, providing a secure gateway to the services offered by Pharm-e-cart. Once authenticated on the site, customers gain access to a comprehensive database of medicines. Within this database, they can seamlessly browse for the availability and pricing of specific products, and place orders with ease, all facilitated by a user-friendly interface.
